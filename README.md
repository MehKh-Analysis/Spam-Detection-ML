# Spam-Detection-ML
Spam messages are a major issue in email and SMS communication, leading to security risks, fraud, and unwanted promotions.
This project focuses on spam detection in text messages using machine learning models. The goal is to classify messages as Spam (1) or Not Spam (0) based on their content.


ðŸ“Œ Models Used

âœ… NaÃ¯ve Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Works well for text classification and is fast, lightweight, and interpretable.
Based on word frequency and assumes words in a message appear independently.

âœ… Logistic Regression
A strong baseline model for binary classification tasks.
Works well with TF-IDF features and provides good precision for detecting spam.

ðŸ“Œ Key Results:
NaÃ¯ve Bayes performed great, making it the recommended model for spam detection.
